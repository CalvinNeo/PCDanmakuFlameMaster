/**
 * Base class for GrGpuResource. Handles the various types of refs we need. Separated out as a base
 * class to isolate the ref-cnting behavior and provide friendship without exposing all of
 * GrGpuResource.
 * 
 * Gpu resources can have three types of refs:
 *   1) Normal ref (+ by ref(), - by unref()): These are used by code that is issuing draw calls
 *      that read and write the resource via GrDrawTarget and by any object that must own a
 *      GrGpuResource and is itself owned (directly or indirectly) by Skia-client code.
 *   2) Pending read (+ by addPendingRead(), - by completedRead()): GrContext has scheduled a read
 *      of the resource by the GPU as a result of a skia API call but hasn't executed it yet.
 *   3) Pending write (+ by addPendingWrite(), - by completedWrite()): GrContext has scheduled a
 *      write to the resource by the GPU as a result of a skia API call but hasn't executed it yet.
 *
 * The latter two ref types are private and intended only for Gr core code.
 *
 * When an item is purgable DERIVED:notifyIsPurgable() will be called (static poly morphism using
 * CRTP). GrIORef and GrGpuResource are separate classes for organizational reasons and to be
 * able to give access via friendship to only the functions related to pending IO operations.
