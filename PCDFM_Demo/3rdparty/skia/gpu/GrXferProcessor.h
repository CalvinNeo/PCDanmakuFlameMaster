/**
 * GrXferProcessor is responsible for implementing the xfer mode that blends the src color and dst
 * color. It does this by emitting fragment shader code and controlling the fixed-function blend
 * state. The inputs to its shader code are the final computed src color and fractional pixel
 * coverage. The GrXferProcessor's shader code writes the fragment shader output color that goes
 * into the fixed-function blend. When dual-source blending is available, it may also write a
 * seconday fragment shader output color. When allowed by the backend API, the GrXferProcessor may
 * read the destination color. The GrXferProcessor is responsible for setting the blend coefficients
 * and blend constant color.
 *
 * A GrXferProcessor is never installed directly into our draw state, but instead is created from a
 * GrXPFactory once we have finalized the state of our draw.
